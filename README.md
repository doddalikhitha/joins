# SQL Joins

## Objective
Combine data from multiple tables using joins.

## Contents
- task5.sql : SQL script with INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL OUTER JOIN queries.

## Key Points
- INNER JOIN between Books, Members, and Loans.
- LEFT JOIN to display members without loans.
- RIGHT JOIN to display books with or without loans.
- FULL OUTER JOIN (using UNION as workaround in MySQL).
